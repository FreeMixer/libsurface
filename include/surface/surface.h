 * libsurface: the device behaviour of a motorised control surface, written once for every
 * surface and every host. The motor-fader policy (never fight the hand), touch with its
 * self-heal and release debounce, the bank window, the board shadow and its replay, the meter
 * step and ring rendering. Every fader is treated the same.
 *
 * What it is not: it speaks no wire (a backend encodes, through struct surface_backend_ops),
 * and it knows no mixing semantics. A host names what a strip shows by an opaque
 * surface_target, maps a key id to a verb in its own table, and owns names, colours and
 * dB laws. The design is FreeMixer/libdiginet#29, sections 4 and 5.
 *
 * No thread, no clock: every call that needs time takes the caller's now_us, and
 * surface_deadline() / surface_tick() run the timers, as libdiginet's session does. One
 * allocation, in surface_create(); nothing after it.

 * Implicit-touch window (ms). Divergent inbound fader reports mean the operator physically has
 * the cap even when the capacitive touch message is momentarily absent: the X-Touch's sensor
 * drops out intermittently mid-move and lags at grab-start. While the window is open, served
 * value -> motor drive is held off for that fader so the motor never fights a moving hand; it
 * is refreshed on every divergent report and lapses once reports stop, restoring normal
 * tracking. This is the canonical DAW "implicit touch" (bjoluc/cubase-mcu-midiremote's
 * motorized-fader handling; DrivenByMoss's MCU touch logic): a per-move debounce keyed to real
 * fader motion, not a fixed grace/reconcile clock.
 *
 * 600 (was 200) since 2026-08-09: the operator reported the fader FIGHTING the hand on the rig,
 * twice. A slow, deliberate ride produces inter-report gaps well past 200 ms, and each gap
 * closed the window; the lagged echo burst then drove the motor into the moving finger, which
 * reads as exaggerated mechanical resistance. 600 covers a musician's slowest deliberate
 * gesture; the cost is only that an EXTERNAL move (another client) reaching a just-released cap
 * is deferred by at most this long, which the eye does not notice and the hand cannot.

/*
 * Served value -> motor drive coalescing (trailing). A gesture's echo comes back as a BURST of
 * frames; driving the motor once per frame walks the cap through every stale intermediate
 * position: with a working touch sensor that only costs noise after release, and with a flaky
 * one it is the fight itself. The motor only ever wants the LATEST truth, so served frames
 * update the target and one trailing deadline drives it once the burst quiets. This is the
 * debouncing asked for, applied on the served -> motor side; surface -> host stays
 * per report, because the engine riding every report is what makes the fader feel connected to

 * (dropped across a host/MIDI reconnect), leaving a strip stuck "touched" so its motor never
 * tracks the host again (observed live: a fader changed the audio from another client but its
 * cap did not move; only a bridge restart cleared it). So the flag also lapses this long after
 * the last touch message for the strip: a genuinely held cap keeps refreshing it (the X-Touch
 * repeats the touch NOTE while held, and a moving cap additionally holds the implicit-touch
 * window open), while a lost release self-heals once the finger is long gone. It may sit below
 * SURFACE_IMPLICIT_TOUCH_MS: a moving cap is held by the implicit window, not by this flag, and
 * a still one by the repeated NOTE.
 *
 * A surface that does not repeat its touch message while held (the Control|24 is assumed not
 * to, libdiginet#29 Q3) sets touch_hold_ms to 0: edges only. That is safe there because DigiNet
 * delivers desk data reliably (the desk retransmits until ACKed), so the lost release this

 * X-Touch's own fall has not been measured). A host that sends a meter only when its LED count
 * changes must therefore re-send the held count inside that window. 250 ms is the measure-free
 * default: short enough that a held level never visibly sags (observed MCU fall is on the order
